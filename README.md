# SamzSpyDev

What is SamzSpy?

In an attempt to address some of the discussed issues, the development of “SamzSpy” will be implemented 
to combat the missing features of current protocol analyzers. SamzSpy will be an integrated network packet 
analyzer tool that is capable of viewing the contents of a network packet and establish the source of heavy 
traffic on a network line.

The main purpose of this integrated tool will comprise one main capability that is often
found missing or not a major feature of current packet analyzer tools. SamzSpy will include 
features such as the monitoring of network packets to view and display content from the header, 
payload, and trailer of a network packet, and the ability to identify the source of heavy traffic 
within a target network.
